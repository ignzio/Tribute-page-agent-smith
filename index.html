            The main antagonist of the trilogy. After being initially destroyed by Neo, he became an Exile and
            manifested as a computer virus with the uncanny ability to copy himself over the minds of bluepills,
            redpills and programs alike.

            <li>

            <li>
                <strong>'The Matrix Revolutions', 2003.</strong> - To Neo: "Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of
                perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence
                that is without meaning or purpose."
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>'The Matrix Reloaded', 2003.</strong> - "We're not here because we're free. We're here because
                we're not free. There's no escaping reason. No denying purpose. Because as we both know without purpose,
                we would not exist."
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>'The Matrix Reloaded', 2003.</strong> - To Neo: "It is purpose that created us, purpose that
                connects us, purpose that pulls us, that guides us, that drives us; it is purpose that defines, purpose
                that binds us."
            </li>
            <li><strong>' The Matrix', 1999.</strong> - "Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural
                equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not."

                -Agent Smith, talking about human beings and the futility of their existence</li>
            <li>
                <strong>'The Matrix', 1999.</strong> - "You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every
                natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is
                another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus."

                -Agent Smith
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> 'The Matrix Reloaded', 2003.</strong> - To Neo: "Still using all the muscles except the one
